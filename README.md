# Ethan's Original SoundFonts

These original musical instrument sample sets have been available freely
since a long time in sf2 format at https://ethanwiner.com/ewsf2.html

This small-size collection converted to SFZ format v2 with ARIA Extensions
and Flac samples by kinwie.

Some fixes and modifications are made for enhancement.
Only two instruments are given user controls and have legato mode:
the Bassoon and Cello.
The Cello also has random feature for attack variations.
Legato CC is sustain pedal cc 64 (right pedal).
Random CC is soft pedal cc 67 (left pedal).
You can peek the used MIDI CC number by clicking the 'blue box'
(Open in Text Editor) in Sforzando's Info page to open the sfz file.
